# Purpose
A for fun web application based on the Final Fantasy Five: Four Job Fiesta that happens every year for chairty. <br />
Based on the idea that any combination of four jobs is able to beat the main game but not the extra bosses. <br />
I wanted to try and recreate the web application for Final Fantasy XII: Zodiac Age. <br />
Where users can generate a run based on certain conditions since Zodiac Age also features a job system and <br />
the ability to have two jobs if the player so desired for each player.


# Currently Working ON
- Setting up the database and tables based on what is needed. <br />
- Setting up the html pages with the options that are possible. <br />
- Ability to see the current ongoing runs in a small table on the home page or on a specific page, <br />
along with showing currently ongoing runs generated by users. <br />
